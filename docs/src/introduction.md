# Introduction

Capti is a lightweight end-to-end testing framework for testing REST APIs. You define your tests in YAML format as an API request and expected response. You can run your tests as often as you like, and even set them up to run in a cloud environment for Continuous Integration.

This documentation serves as your guide for developing your end-to-end tests. Start by visiting the [Installation](chapter_2.md) pages to learn how you can set up Capti to run with your project.
