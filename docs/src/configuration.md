# Configuration

There are many ways to configure Capti for your testing needs. You can configure various options for:

- [Individual tests](./configuration/tests.md)
- [Test suites](./configuration/suites.md)
- [Global config](./configuration/config.md)
- CLI arguments

For individual tests, you can configure how your test is run and evaluated. For test suites, you can set up variables, determine whether tests should run sequentially or parallel, and establish any scripts to run before and after each test. And lastly, you can establish a global config file that runs scripts before and after all test suites are run.
