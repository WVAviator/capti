# Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to Capti, please reach out! I'd love to collaborate on new ideas and the future of Capti tests. Feel free to help with any of the below items, or by [creating an issue](./reporting_issues.md).

## Development

If you're even just a little familiar with Rust, I'd love your help in developing components of Capti and fixing bugs. Especially if you are experienced in working with serde or reqwest.

Additionally, if you'd like to help write some Node/Express/TypeScript code for the test app so that more scenarios can be used for examples and testing, that would be a huge help.

The future of Capti may involve elements such as custom LSPs, syntax highlighting for YAML files, VSCode extensions, etc. If you have experience with any of these, I would appreciate your help.

## Testing

Want to help test Capti? If you happen to have a few REST APIs laying around that you've developed over the years, use Capti to create some tests for them. Try testing various use cases and see if you come across any limitations or issues. 

## Feature Suggestions

Have an idea that might improve Capti? I'm all ears. I have a lot of ideas I'd like to implement in the future, but I'm always open to new and thoughtful suggestions - especially from users of the framework.
